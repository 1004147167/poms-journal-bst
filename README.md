# Production and Operations Management Journal (POMS) BibTeX style file

*Disclaimer:* This is not an official file but just our custom-made one.

According to the submission guidelines ( http://www.poms.org/journal/author_instructions/ ), a literature source should have a format like:

    Hayes, R. H., G. P. Pisano. 1996. Manufacturing strategy: At the intersection of two paradigm shifts. Production and Operations Management, 5 (1), 25-41.

The subtlety is that the first author's last name is shown first while follow-up authors have their first name first.

This BST file accounts for that. If you have additional comments, feel free to create a pull request or an issue.
